# Marketing-Campaigns-for-Facebook-Vs-AdWords-Ads

A data-driven analysis comparing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns across two major advertising platforms — **Facebook Ads** and **Google AdWords** — using metrics like conversions, clicks, CTR, CPC, and conversion rate.

---

## 🧠 Objective

This project aims to answer:
- Which platform is more cost-effective for conversions?
- Is there a stable relationship between advertising spend and conversion performance?
- What machine learning models best predict conversion outcomes based on ad performance data?

## 📊 Data Description

Each record includes the following metrics for both platforms:

- `ad_views`: Number of ad impressions
- `ad_clicks`: Number of clicks received
- `conversions`: Number of successful actions taken by users (e.g., purchases)
- `cost_per_ad`: Total cost per campaign
- `CTR (Click-Through Rate)`: Clicks / Views
- `Conversion Rate`: Conversions / Clicks
- `Cost Per Click`: Cost / Clicks
- `Cost Per Conversion (CPC)`: Cost / Conversions
